This is my personal webpage, it's by no means complete but provides some information about what I've been up to. TL;DR I'm in the process of transitioning from research to entrepreneurship, and currently in the Entrepreneur First cohort (London) looking to build a startup in the AI safety/robustness space.

Prior to joining EF, I was a researcher at Five AI which was acquired by Bosch, during the role I consulted for the Bosch SafeAI team, and published papers on robustness of vision models and mechanistic interpretability. Before that I was a PhD student at the Torr Vision Group in Oxford which included an internship at Meta. During my time there I mainly focussed on robustness, multimodal learning and semi-supervised learning.

I am a co-founder of GirlsWhoML, a not for profit to improve gender diversity in AI. We deliver courses to university students to aid access into further study or industry; we have had over 500 students pass through the program. Please get in touch if you would like to help in any way.
