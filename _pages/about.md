This is my personal webpage, it's by no means complete but provides some information about what I've been up to. TL;DR I'm building a company that predicts a userâ€™s next action on ecommerce stores, this enables real time analytics and actions for ecommerce owners to: proactively engage customers on their site and reduce cart abandonment; personalise the customer journey depending on if they are a visitor or a buyer; and provide acrionable changes on how the site should be changed (i.e. not just heatmaps). 

Prior to this, I was on Entrepreneur First, where I explored a bunch of ideas with various founders before finding my co-founder Zac Babecoff. Before that, I was a researcher at Five AI which was acquired by Bosch, during the role I consulted for the Bosch SafeAI team, and published papers on robustness of vision models and mechanistic interpretability. Before that I was a PhD student at the Torr Vision Group in Oxford which included an internship at Meta. During my time there I mainly focussed on robustness, multimodal learning and semi-supervised learning.

I am a co-founder of GirlsWhoML, a charity improving gender diversity in AI. We run courses to aid access to further study or industry; we are currently operating in over 10 locations around the UK, India, Pakistan and Brazil. Please get in touch if you would like to help in any way.
