Paradoxes and Misconceptions in AI
======

This is just me rambling about issues and paradoxes that currently plague the field of AI.

The State of AI
------
Typically, the current approach of developing an AI model is to optimise a loss/cost function on some trainig dataset. Typically, we bake in numerous handcrafted and emperically motivated inductive biases into the model; this takes the form of components such as BatchNorm, SpectralNormaliation, Attention Mechanisms etc. Crafting these models in a certain way enables practitioners to obtain high performance on certain, specific tasks. Through this, we've seen many prominent models hit the headlines such as: alphaGO, chatGPT, stableDiffusion, alphaFold, Tesla Autopilot, etc. Indicating that the approach of train then deploy can be fruitful at developing specific tools for unique tasks. However, I would consider this approach to be incredibly rigid, with almost all of the focus being directed at constructing these models and obtianing datasets that are appropriate.
